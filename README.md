This repository contains MATLAB code used for analyses associated with:

Townshend et al., “A Multiplexed, Automated Evolution Pipeline Enables Scalable Discovery and Characterization of Biosensors.”

Note that many of the analyses depend upon data stored in a mysql database which is not included in this release.   As such, the code here is meant to be instructive and to document the methods used for the analyses in the paper.
